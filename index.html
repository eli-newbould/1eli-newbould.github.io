            <h3>What Is A Bernedoodle?</h3>
                <p>A Bernedoodle is a mix 
                    between a Poodle and a 
                    Bernese Mountain Dog.   
                    These dogs have low to 
                    non-shedding coats. Bernedoodles
                    tend to be highly intelligent,
                    hardworking when necessary,
                    loyal, and just a bit goofy.
                    They are good with children
                    and other dogs, provided
                    they have been well socialized.
                    They are a good choice for a family
                    pet, as they are people-oriented,
                    they love to spend time with the
                    family, engaging in all activities
                    and games, but they will also calmly
                    cuddle in the sofa, taking great
                    pleasure of time spent close to 
                    humans. 
                </p>

            <h3>What Is A Goldendoodle?</h3>   
                <p>A Goldendoodle is a mix between
                    a Poodle and a Golden Retriever.
                    These dogs have low to non-shedding
                    coats. Goldendoodles are an intelligent
                    and obedient family companion. They
                    are everybody's friend and devoted
                    to their family. They are friendly
                    towards children, other dogs and pets,
                    and easy with strangers. They are social
                    dogs, happiest when with people. Their
                    intelligence, eagerness to please, and
                    love of learning make them very easy to train.
                    They also love to be active, going on walks, hikes, 
                    swimming, whatever you like!
