		<h2>About Us and our Puppies</h2>
        <h3>Our Family</h3>
        <p>
            We are a home breeder of Medium/Mini/Teacup
            Goldendoodles and Mini Bernedoodles located
            outside of Salt Lake City. Our dogs are selectively
            bred from quality health-tested parents with excellent
            temperaments and beautiful coats. We believe in raising
            our puppies inside the home so they will get the early
            puppy development and love they need and deserve.</p>
        <p>
            We have had many dogs over the last few years
            and when we adopted our first Goldendoodle,
            our lives changed forever. We couldn't have just one.
            At P&P Pups, these animals are an extension of our home
            and treated like a member of the family. We have been
            raising Goldendoodle puppies since 2016 and have
            loved every minute of it. Our goal is to raise happy,
            healthy puppies as we strive to give them early
            neurological stimulation and socialization in
            preparation to go home with their new family.
            Each puppy is vaccinated and receives a complete
            vet check and health guarantee upon delivery.
            We welcome the opportunity to find a puppy that is
            right for you!
